==Obstacles in learning API==
_[http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MS.2009.193 What Makes APIs Hard to Learn? Answers from Developers]_

50/74 people face problems related to resources for learning API
Out of these :
*40% do not find adequate examples*
28% problems with documentation
*18% No reference on how to use the API to accomplish a specific task*

Notes about examples: 
  * Examples help understand purpose of library, usage protocol and usage context.
  * 3 types of code examples:
    # *Snippets:* Few lines of code intended to demonstrate how to access the API. *Inadequacy*:  Cannot help in putting things together.
    # *Tutorials:* multiple code segments forming a more or less complete application
    # *Applications:* code segments from complex applications that can be downloaded from open source repositories. 
  * *Users progressively move* from _snippets_ to _applications_ to support their needs. 
  * People need examples for: 
    # learning best practices
    # design of code that uses the API
    # rationale about API's design
