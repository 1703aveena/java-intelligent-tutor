#summary Story board to create tutorial file readable by CTAT

*Module Description:* Converting code to tutorial when all information is available.
Involved program files:

*Input:* This module will be called after relevant code has been searched from the repository. It will also receive information regarding the words (& its location in the code) to be hidden in the tutorial.

*Output:* It will create a source code file that can be fed to CTAT for Java, which will eventually open it as a tutorial.

*Story points:*

  * The static fields of the CTAT-GUI source code file should be sought from a static class or from a text file for enabling changes in future. Identify these static fields and create required architecture.

  * This module will be triggered along with list of config objects, i.e. the list of choices finalized by the teacher.

*Other Notes:*
